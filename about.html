<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hello. I am Malladi Subrahmanyam, a government servant with more than 30 years of service.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time, I read Telugu Stories and listen to music, particularly those of Ghantasala, Ramakrishna, P Susheela, S. Janaki
 and the like in the old Telugu Films.
I am particularly fond of Ghantasala's rendition of the Bhagavadgeeta. I am also interested in Hinduism and the philosophy of
 Adi Shankaracharya.
<br><br>
So, some of what I will be posting here will be related to these topics.
