## This is my place

Here I will be writing about my favourite places, books, authors, singers and personalities. You are welcome to read them and I hope you will enjoy them.

Now, something about me.

I am a 30 years experienced Government employee. I have degrees in commerce and law. 

I enjoy reading Telugu stories and listening to old Telugu songs. I am also interested in Hindu religion and the philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya.

I am a listener of the Pravachanams of Shri Chaganty garu and Shri Garikipati garu.
